Steps on Ubantu to install hid library 
------------------
I followed the instructions at  https://pypi.org/project/hid/

1) first chec if pip is instlled, pip is  not default in Ubantu
$ sudo apt install python3-pip python-dev

check the installation by running the following command
$ pip3 --version 

2)Since pyhidapi is dependant upon the hidapi library, which must be installed separately  
$ apt install libhidapi-hidraw0

3) Now we I intalled hid library using pip (pip3 actually) 
pip3 install hid


************The above method did not work************
so change of plans, since i suspec the problem is wiht the hid library,
I am going to no use that and use the pyUSB library, Althoug it was not
abvious at first it seems pyUSB uses libUSB as a baase, Earlier 
I though that that the two were seprate 
* the pyUSB is the python language binding for libUSB


I base my research on the following sources 
https://os.mbed.com/cookbook/USBHID-bindings-
https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/robots/controlling-your-robot-wireless-keyboard
https://libusb.info/

installing lib usb (it was already installed in my system)
----------------------------------------------------------
1)$ sudo apt-get update -y
2)$ sudo apt-get install -y libusb-1.0-0

to check the installation 
$ dpkg -l libusb-1.0*

installing pyUSB
-----------------
1) $pip3 install pyusb

the linux test is in pyUSB_test.py, for some reason this did not fully work in the virtual machine.
but it worked sucessfully in raspberry pi , we had run it with sudo privillages 
$sudo python3 pyUSB_test.py 

*********************** seting up for windows **************************
I used anaconda so I installed lib usb first using anaconda
https://anaconda.org/m-labs/libusb
conda install -c m-labs libusb

I used anaconda to install the pyUSB
https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyusb
conda install -c conda-forge pyusb

the windows test is in pyUSB_Windows_test.py
but the hid_device.is_kernel_driver_active(2) call did not work in windows
